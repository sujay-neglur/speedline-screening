### Project Structure

1. The first implementation is present in the file _first.js_
1. The second implementation is present in the file _second.js_
1. The file _firstFixed.js_ contains the bug fix for the implementation proposed in _first.js_
1. The file _secondFixed.js_ contains the bug fix for the implementation proposed in _second.js_
1. The file _first.test.js_ contains the test scenarios for the implementation proposed in _first.js_
1. The file _firstFixed.test.js_ contains the test scenarios for the bug fix proposed in _firstFixed.js_
1. The file _second.test.js_ contains the test scenarios for the implementation proposed in _second.js_
1. The file _secondFixed.test.js_ contains the test scenarios for the bug fix proposed in _secondFixed.js_

### Steps to run

1. Clone the project using `git clone https://github.com/sujayneglur123/speedline-screening.git` or download the zip file and extract it.
1. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the dependencies (jest).
1. Execute the command `npm run printwinners1` to run the test scenarios for the file _first.js_. The test which catches the bug will fail.
1. Execute the command `npm run printwinners1fixed` to run the test scenarios for the file _firstFixed.js_. The test scenario that failed in _first.test.js_ will pass.
1. Execute the command `npm run printwinners2` to the run the test scenarios for the file _second.js_. The test which catches the bug will fail.
1. Execute the command `npm run printwinners2fixed` to run the test scenarios for the file _secondFixed.js_. The test scenario that failed in _second.test.js_ will pass.

### Answers to the Questions

##### Describe some data sets that you would use to test any proposed implementation and its accuracy.

[Datasets](https://github.com/sujayneglur123/speedline-screening/wiki/Datasets)

##### Did you identify any bugs in these proposed implementations?

[Bugs in the proposed implementations](https://github.com/sujayneglur123/speedline-screening/wiki/Bugs-in-the-proposed-implementations)

##### Once any small bugs are fixed, will either of these approaches give us the output we're looking for?

[Bug Fixes](https://github.com/sujayneglur123/speedline-screening/wiki/Bug-Fixes)

##### What are some advantages or disadvantages of these approaches?

[Advantages and Disadvantages](https://github.com/sujayneglur123/speedline-screening/wiki/Advantages-and-Disadvantages)

##### If we were querying a database instead of working with an in-memory structure, would we use a significantly different algorithm to find the winners? If so, how would you expect that algorithm to differ in performance and why?
